Tokyo District Court Case No. Heisei 29 (Re) No. 35   
Rehabilitation Debtor: MTGOX Co., Ltd.   

Subject: Concerns Regarding MtGox Rehabilitation Proceedings   

Respected Members of the Court,   


I am writing to express serious concerns and dissatisfaction regarding the MtGox rehabilitation proceedings and the repeatedly extended deadlines. As a creditor in these proceedings, I believe it is my duty to convey my concerns and request clear explanations on several important matters.

Firstly, it is unacceptable that the deadlines for the MtGox rehabilitation plan have been repeatedly extended. The original deadlines were set with the understanding that they would be adhered to, but the repeated delays have caused significant uncertainty and financial burden for creditors, including myself. We have been waiting for a resolution, and these repeated extensions have eroded our trust in the process.

Secondly, it is concerning that neither the court, which accepts these extensions, nor the Rehabilitation Trustee, who requests these extensions, provides clear and transparent explanations to creditors. The role of the court is crucial in ensuring that these proceedings are conducted fairly and efficiently, and creditors rely on the court's involvement and oversight. The lack of communication regarding the reasons behind these extensions raises questions about the court's monitoring and involvement.

Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, it is essential to receive detailed and comprehensive explanations with each extension of the repayment deadline. Without such information, we are left in the dark and unable to make informed decisions or take measures to prevent future delays. We have the right to know why these delays are occurring, what measures are being taken to prevent future delays, and what the realistic timeline for resolution is.

I respectfully request that the court promptly addresses these concerns and takes the necessary measures to provide transparency and information to creditors. We have endured years of uncertainty, and we hope the court will take our concerns seriously and act in the best interests of all MtGox creditors.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to receiving a response that addresses the points raised herein.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
