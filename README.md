## About the bot

The twitter bot @MtGoxBalanceBot observes the current balances and outgoing transactions on all known MtGox addresses supposedly held by the MtGox trustee. 

Outgoing transactions are also tracked and will result in a tweet containing the address and amount sent. 

This bot builds on public APIs and services from blockchain.info, cryptocurrencyalerting.com and make.com. Please note, all of these services can fail, be delayed or might undergo changes which break the bot. Always verify the output yourself.

The addresses observed have been identified by Kim Nilsson ([@nikuhodai](https://twitter.com/nikuhodai)) of WizSecurity ([@wizsecurity](https://twitter.com/wizsecurity)). The list was published in this [reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgoxinsolvency/comments/82m0dl/comment/dvd2vre/). Please follow Kim and WizSecurity on Twitter and check out his blog at [wizsec.com](https://blog.wizsec.jp/), he has excellent content, not only MtGox related. Also, please consider a donation to the BTC address on the bottom of his blog site.

## Note

An outgoing transaction from one of this addresses does not necessarily mean these coins will be distributed or sold shortly after. It just means they are being moved. Don't jump to conclusions too quick.

## Frequently asked questions about MtGox coins

### What balances is the trustee currently holding)?
As declared in documents published during creditors meetings ([document here](http://www.mtgox.com/img/pdf/20191001_report.pdf)), the trustee currently (2022/09/21) holds ***141,686.35371099 BTC (Bitcoin)*** and ***142,846.35166254 BCH (Bitcoin Cash)***. The trustee also has or had BSV (Bitcoin Shitty Version), but it's unknown if it was already dumped as the trustee communicated in the Rehabilitation Plan Draft.

### Will the trustee dump all crypto coldings for fiat?
No. Creditors will be able to select, if they want their share to be paid in crypto or in fiat. If they select crypto, they can claim them with the exchange designated by the trustee. If they select fiat, the trustee or the designated exchange will sell those coins and payout fiat. We have no information if this will be done on the open market or OTC.

### When will the MtGox coins be released?
Nobody (maybe except the trustee) currently (2022/09/21) knows. On September 15, 2022, the ***Setting of Assignment, etc. Restriction Reference Period*** started as announced [here](http://www.mtgox.com/img/pdf/20220831_announcement_en.pdf). During the Setting of Assignment, etc. Restriction Reference Period, transfers of claims are not permitted. That is all the documents said. Many observers think that will mean that the distribution of funds will start from September 12, 2022, but the previous experiences with the trustee should make it clear that this won't happen soon.

### OK. But when MtGox coins?
What we know is that ***some things need to happen before any fiat or crypto payments from the trustee can be expected*** (checkbox indicates if this was already done): 

- [ ] All creditors will need to go through KYC with the trustee
- [ ] Trustee has to inform about the "Intermediate Repayment" which would allow those creditors who will choose the "Final Payment" (FP) option in contrast to the "Early Lump Sum Payment" (ELSP) option, to receive something together with those who have chosen ELSP.
- [ ] creditors need to select ELSP or FP in "The System"
- [ ] creditors need to select payout in crypto or fiat in "The System" (the trustee already asked about this, but only as an opinion poll, not as a binding decision)
- [ ] In order to receive the fiat payments all creditors are entitled to, bank account info has to be collected in "The System"
- [ ] The trustee needs to inform about the exchanges / agents he selected for the distribution of crypto
- [ ] Creditors need to register with these exchanges and probably go through KYC again (assuming that KYC data won't be passed from the trustee to the exchange.
- [ ] Coins need to move to the designated exchanges

Well informed observers do not believe that any BTC will be claimable in 2022. We also do not know to what extent the trustee will speed up the distribution by doing things in parallel. We had seen in the past that every phase (eg onboarding of all Z-creditors (smal sum creditors)) took a few months and nothing else happened in the meantime. The trustee is not known to do things in parallel. 

### Will all crypto holdings be released at once?
No. Those creditors who choose the "Final Payment" option will most likely get their last portion once pending ligitation (eg. by Coinlib) is resolved. These creditors will be able to get an early crypto payment through the "Intermediate Repayment", which should happen together with the "Early Lump Sum Payments". But currently, we have no information about the "Intermediate Repayment".

### Will MtGox creditors sell all their coins, once they get them?
We don't know. But imagine you were a creditor, seeing BTC going to 69k$ in 2021, would you then sell them below 20k$ in 2022? Also, those creditors in urgent need of money had the occasion to sell their claims to claim buyers and some already did. In informal votes in a telegram group more than 60% of more than 250 creditors indicated they won't sell their crypto once they get it. Some said they would even buy more for the fiat portion they will receive from the trustee. While this is all anectotal, it seems obvious to me that most creditors, which are crypto OGs, won't sell at the bottom of the 2022 bear market.

### Who are the biggest MtGox creditors?
The biggest creditors are the claim buyers from Fortress (Michael Hourigan), Capital 507 (Thomas Braziel) and Bitcoinbuilder (Josh Jones). Black Rock is not known to be a claim buyer. The Black Rock story is probably just fud and conspiracy theory.
